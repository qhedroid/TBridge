# Qhedroid Engineering Standard

## Purpose

This document defines the reusable engineering structure for Qhedroid portfolio projects.

Every project should feel consistent, maintainable and professional from day one.

This standard applies to projects such as:

TBridge
SnipKit
DocShot
MediaForge
CueBot
Personal browser projects
Future portfolio utilities

Faide is separate because it is a startup product, but it may borrow selected practices.

## Core Principle

Build small, useful products with serious engineering discipline.

The goal is not to overengineer.

The goal is to avoid messy one-off projects.

Every project should have:

Clear purpose
Clean architecture
Good documentation
Simple deployment
Reliable build process
Consistent design quality

Only create folders that are actually needed.

Do not create empty placeholder folders just to satisfy the template.

## Required Documentation

### PRODUCT_BRIEF.md

Explains:

What the product is
Who it is for
What problem it solves
What V1 includes
What V1 does not include
Example user flows

### TECHNICAL_BRIEF.md

Explains:

Stack choice
Architecture
Data model
Core logic
Testing approach
Known risks
Deployment target

### DESIGN_BRIEF.md

Explains:

Visual direction
Tone
Spacing
Typography
Interaction style
Accessibility expectations
What to avoid

### ROADMAP.md

Explains:

V1
V1.1
V2
Future ideas
Deferred features

### CHANGELOG.md

Tracks:

Features shipped
Bug fixes
Design changes
Technical changes

### QA_CHECKLIST.md

Tracks manual checks before release.

### ADR/

Architecture Decision Records.

Use ADRs for important decisions such as:

Why this stack was chosen
Why there is no backend
Why a specific library was used
Why a feature was deferred

## Standard Build Phases

### Phase 0 — Discovery

Define the problem.

Do not code yet.

Output:

PRODUCT_BRIEF.md

### Phase 1 — Architecture

Define the technical approach.

Output:

TECHNICAL_BRIEF.md
Initial ADRs

### Phase 2 — MVP Build

Build the smallest useful version.

Rules:

No unnecessary features
No backend unless required
No database unless required
No auth unless required
No UI library unless justified

### Phase 3 — Functional Polish

Improve:

Edge cases
State handling
URL sharing
Copy/export behaviour
Search
Validation
Testing

### Phase 4 — Design Pass

Use Claude Design only after the app works.

Design should improve:

Typography
Spacing
Hierarchy
Density
Interaction states
Mobile behaviour
Accessibility

Design should not introduce random new features.

### Phase 5 — QA

Run:

npm test
npm run build
Manual browser test
Mobile layout check

### Phase 6 — Release

Push to GitHub.
Deploy to Vercel.
Use free Vercel URL first.
Add custom domain only after V1 is worth keeping.

## Default Web App Stack

Use this unless there is a strong reason not to:

Vite
React
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Vitest
Vercel

Optional:

Luxon for timezone/date-heavy apps
Zod for complex validation
Playwright only when browser flows become important

Avoid by default:

Redux
Heavy UI libraries
Premature backend
Premature database
Premature authentication
Premature analytics
Complex routing for one-page apps

## Claude Usage Model

Use ChatGPT as product lead and technical reviewer.

Use Claude Cowork for:

Architecture review
Trade-off review
Planning
Repository structure
Refactoring judgement

Use Claude Code for:

Implementation
Tests
Build fixes
Feature execution

Use Claude Design for:

Visual refinement
UI hierarchy
Interaction polish
Design system improvements

## Standard Claude Code Rules

Claude Code must:

Read all docs before coding
Follow CLAUDE.md
Keep scope tight
Run tests before completion
Run production build before completion
Summarise changes clearly

Claude Code must not:

Add features without approval
Add backend without approval
Add database without approval
Add auth without approval
Add large dependencies without justification
Leave TODO comments
Leave dead code
Ignore TypeScript errors

## Standard Design Philosophy

Qhedroid projects should feel:

Useful
Calm
Fast
Practical
Human-made
Professional
Slightly distinctive

Avoid:

Generic AI SaaS styling
Glassmorphism
Unnecessary gradients
Huge cards everywhere
Oversized rounded corners
Dashboard clutter
Marketing-page design where utility design is needed

Design should be typography-led.

Spacing and rhythm matter more than decoration.

## Standard Release Checklist

Before GitHub push:

npm install
npm test
npm run build

Manual checks:

App loads locally
Core happy path works
Known examples pass
Mobile layout works
Copy/share actions work
No console errors
README is accurate
Docs are up to date

Before Vercel deploy:

Repo is clean
Build passes locally
No secrets committed
No unnecessary files committed
README has run instructions

## Git Commit Style

Use clear commits:

feat: build TBridge v1
fix: correct timezone alias resolution
style: refine result card layout
docs: add engineering standard
test: add DST conversion coverage
chore: configure Vercel deployment

## Portfolio Standard

Every completed project should eventually have:

Live demo
GitHub repo
README
Screenshots
Short technical write-up
Clear explanation of what was learned

The goal is for each project to be useful on its own and credible as part of a professional engineering portfolio.
